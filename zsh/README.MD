## Setup

Currently just handling some aliases here rather than copy over all configs to `.zshrc`. 

## Steps

In order to use this follow these steps 

1. Run OH-MY-ZSH setup, before any of this. 
2. Add the following line to the `.zshrc` in the root repo.
	```
		[ -f ~/.config/zsh/config.sh ] && source ~/.config/zsh/config.sh 
	```
